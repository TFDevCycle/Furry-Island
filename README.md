# Welcome to Green Valley

Green Valley is a simple Gameboy game that I created as my first game development project. It's a classic 2D Top-Down where you play as a character who must navigate through the World of Green Valley, Quest and enemies to reach a new Level of Relationships and Skill your Character up.

## Getting Started

To play the game, you'll need a Gameboy emulator installed on your computer. You can find many free Gameboy emulators online that you can download and install.

Like Bizhawk or something else...

Once you have an emulator installed, download the game ROM file and load it into the emulator to start playing.

## Controls

The game controls are simple and easy to learn:

- D-pad: Move left or right and Top or Down
- A button: Interact
- B button: Attack (once you acquire a weapon)
- Start button: To open the Menu (where you can open the Diary, Inventory or Save the Game)

## Gameplay

In Green Valley, you play as a character who must navigate through the World of Green Valley, its own unique Quest and Npcs. Along the way, you'll collect powerful Armor or Weapons and Skill your Character up that will help you in your journey.

The game features a Complex Quest system, with Currency systems for defeating enemies and complete Quests.

## Credits

## Future Development

I plan to continue developing Green Valley and adding new features and quests in the future. Stay tuned for updates and new releases!

Fork of binji's Game Boy emulator built as a WebAssembly module.

It includes changes from [Daid's fork](https://github.com/daid/binjgb) and others to better support GB Studio.
