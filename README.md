# Game Name

Game Name is a simple Gameboy game that I created as my first game development project. It's a classic side-scrolling platformer where you play as a character who must navigate through various levels, jumping over obstacles and enemies to reach the end goal.

## Getting Started

To play the game, you'll need a Gameboy emulator installed on your computer. You can find many free Gameboy emulators online that you can download and install.

Once you have an emulator installed, download the game ROM file and load it into the emulator to start playing.

## Controls

The game controls are simple and easy to learn:

- D-pad: Move left or right
- A button: Jump
- B button: Shoot (once you acquire a weapon)

## Gameplay

In Game Name, you play as a character who must navigate through various levels, each with its own unique challenges and obstacles. Along the way, you'll collect power-ups and weapons that will help you in your journey.

The game features a simple scoring system, with points awarded for defeating enemies and collecting items.

It includes changes from [Daid's fork](https://github.com/daid/binjgb) and others to better support GB Studio.
